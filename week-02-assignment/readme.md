## This week I learned how to use

- Github
- Atom
- SourceTree

I also got some experience using the GitHub Desktop. In most of these things, I learned how to commit changes and monitor my progress on assignments. There were a couple of text files that I created to help with learning the applications.

### I just followed along with the course page, downloaded and learned how to use the proper applications and did my best to commit all of the commands to memory.

This week I didn't really seem to have any issues. I was a little late getting to the assignment, but by following along with the instructions and doing some reading I figured everything out pretty easily.

I'm not sure there is one thing in particular that I learned that I want to discuss further, I'm just excited to see what kinds of things these new applications will allow me to do.

I didn't get around to helping out on any classmate issues this week.
