# Week 09 Assignment

## Jackson Wagner

After a very frustrating week last week, I kind of got back into the swing of things this week. It took me a while to get anything going on my live website, but I finally got my css and html to work together. I had messes around with my resume for quite a while today, so all the info was still fresh in my mind and I figured I'd put together a very rough version of it on this webpage.

I felt like I understood most of what I was doing. I put in a header with a dropdown menu, I threw a border around my text and filled it in, added a column that floated on the side.

My color scheme felt kind of patriotic, but I liked the softer tones of red and blue. I also messed with the font a bit -one of the options you get after entering on font-family is fantasy, which probably isn't great for an actual resume but I liked it.
