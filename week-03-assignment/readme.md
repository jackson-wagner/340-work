## Learning how to make html pages

This week I learned how to make html pages and make them go live.
It started with learning the history of the language itself and why we use it. After that, I learned about the elements and tags that the language consists of. I also learned how to make things like:
- headers
- paragraphs
- horizontal lines
- page breaks

I combined all of this info into one index.html file and made my very first live webpage. I struggled for a while with getting the live site to work, but realized after working on some different things that I wasn't pushing my files to the correct place. After fixing that problem, the site was up in seconds and everthing looked good.
