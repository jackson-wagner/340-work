  <h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
  <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
  <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.<br />
    His house is in the village though;<br />
    He will not see me stopping here<br />
    To watch his woods fill up with snow<br />
    <br />
    My little horse must think it queer<br />
    To stop without a farmhouse near<br />
    Between the woods and frozen lake<br />
    The darkest evening of the year.<br />
    <br />
    He gives his harness bells a shake<br />
    To ask if there is some mistake.<br />
    The only other sounds the sweep<br />
    Of easy wind and downy flake<br />
    <br />
    The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br />
    But I have promises to keep,<br />
    And miles to go before I sleep,<br />
    And miles to go before I sleep<br />
