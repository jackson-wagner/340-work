  This is a story written by Rick Moody. We read it and discussed it in a creative writing
  class I had last semester and I thought I would share it now.

  Boys enter the house, boys enter the house. Boys, and with them the ideas of boys (ideas
leaden, reductive, inflexible), enter the house. Boys, two of them, wound into hospital
packaging, boys with infant-pattern baldness, slung in the arms of parents, boys dreaming of
breasts, enter the house. Twin boys, kettles on the boil, boys in hideous vinyl knapsacks that
young couples from Edison, NJ., wear on their shirt fronts, knapsacks coated with baby saliva
and staphylococcus and milk vomit, enter the house. Two boys, one striking the other with a
rubberized hot dog, enter the house. Two boys, one of them striking the other with a willow
switch about the head and shoulders, the other crying, enter the house. Boys enter the house
speaking nonsense. Boys enter the house calling for mother. On a Sunday, in May, a day one
might nearly describe as perfect, an ice cream truck comes slowly down the lane, chimes in-
ducing salivation, and children run after it, not long after which boys dig a hole in the back
yard and bury their younger sister's dolls two feet down, so that she will never find these
dolls and these dolls will rot in hell, after which boys enter the house. Boys, trailing after
their father like he is the Second Goddamned Coming of Christ Goddamned Almighty, enter
the house, repair to the basement to watch baseball. Boys enter the house, site of devastation,
and repair immediately to the kitchen, where they mix lighter fluid, vanilla pudding, drain-
opening lye, balsamic vinegar, blue food coloring, calamine lotion, cottage cheese, ants, a
plastic lizard one of them received in his Christmas stocking, tacks, leftover mashed potatoes,
Spam, frozen lima beans, and chocolate syrup in a medium-sized saucepan and heat over a
low flame until thick, afterward transferring the contents of this saucepan into a Pyrex lasa-
gna dish, baking the Pyrex lasagna dish in the oven for nineteen minutes before attempting to
persuade their sister that she should eat the mixture; later they smash three family heirlooms
(the last, a glass egg, intentionally) in a two-and-a-half-hour stretch, whereupon they are sent
to their bedroom until freed, in each case thirteen minutes after. Boys enter the house, starchy
in pressed shirts and flannel pants that itch so bad, fresh from Sunday school instruction,
blond and brown locks (respectively) plastered down but even so with a number of cowlicks
protruding at odd angles, disconsolate and humbled, uncertain if boyish things — such as
shooting at the neighbor's dog with a pump-action BB gun and gagging the fat boy up the
street with a bandanna and showing their shriveled boy-penises to their younger sister — are
exempted from the commandment to Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all
thy soul and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself. Boys enter the house in baseball
gear (only one of the boys can hit): in their spikes, in mismatched tube socks that smell like
Stilton cheese. Boys enter the house in soccer gear. Boys enter the house carrying skates.
Boys enter the house with lacrosse sticks, and soon after, tossing a lacrosse ball lightly in the
living room, they destroy a lamp. One boy enters the house sporting basketball clothes, the
other wearing jeans and a sweatshirt. One boy enters the house bleeding profusely and is
taken out to get stitches, the other watches. </p>
