# Week 08 Assignment

## Jackson Wagner

This was a very frustrating week for me. It started with a confusion over CSS. I must have missed some info from last week because I struggled a lot with the format of the CSS page. I wasn't sure how to link my html page and my css page together.

I also had a lot of issues with Atom for some reason. When I went to work on Monday night after reading through everything my Atom wouldn't respond. It took me almost a day to get it back up and running which kind of sucked.

To add on to all of that, my SourceTree went goofy on me. When I went to push my files to my github page, an error message kept popping up. I tried a bunch of different things but I couldn't get it to push my files.
