## week-06-assignment

This week I'm finishing up learning about html with some more tags. It started with how to give tags an ID and a class, but there is also information about embedding audio and video files in. I found it much easier to embed YouTube and Google Maps than I expected. I guess it makes sense that companies that are that high tech would make it easy for you to embed links, but still.

My website was pretty basic, but I think everything worked out pretty well. One thing that I'm trying to do is go back and look through my old html codes from past assignments for refreshers on how to do everything, and I think it is helping out a bunch.
