# Week 5

## Images
This week I continued working on HTML, now adding images into the mix. I learned how to originally add the images, what types of things I should look out for (height, width, resolution), how to align the images and what to do to add captions onto the images. When I went through the homework, I found myself struggling to get the image to show up on the page.

## Tables
I then moved on to tables, getting familiar with creating rows and columns to make complex information much more digestable. As a sports journalist, this is something that I see very often and would like to get familiar with.

## Forms
The next portion of the homework dealt with all sorts of different elements that you can put into forms. I'm not going to lie, I got a little lost during this section. There was just a lot of information to digest and I didn't quite understand exactly how it all worked together. When finishing the homework I came back to the pages to find specific information quite a bit. I struggled in particular with what the form and action line meant and what I should insert into there.

## Homework
I chose to base my homework around a golf questionnaire. I included three pictures, one generic golf photo, one of a player I included in a question and one of a ball I included in a question. I had radio buttons, checkboxes, long and short text boxes with a placeholder and a drop down menu.
