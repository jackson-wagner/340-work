<p>Just writing this makes me think of a great quote by <abbr title-"doctor">Dr.</abbr> Not Chose</p>
<blockquote>Each day is like a fresh bowl of nachos</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I look at the images in <cite>Ultimate Nachos</cite> for inspiration.<br />
  Eating nachos for breakfast is a <del>horrible</del> <ins>great</ins> idea.

  <ol>
    <li> Cook the ground beef.
      <ul>
        <li>I usually do this in a skillet.
          <li>Make sure you add seasoning after the meat is brown.
          </ul>
          <li>Put some chips on a plate.</li>
            <li> Sprinkle shredded cheese on the chips and microwave for 20 seconds.</li>
              <li>Chop the onion.</li>
                <li>Combine the meat, onions and salsa with the chips and cheese.</li>
                  <li>Enjoy.</li><br />
                  There are also some other types of nachos, which you can find <a href="definitions.html">here.</a>
