<h1>Week 4</h1>

<ol>
<li>This week I learned some more about HTML and the different elements and tags. I learned how to make lists, both ordered and unordered, link to outside pages and emails. </li>
<li>I also learned how to use a lot of semantic language.</li>
<li>I looked back at some old websites. One of them was Grantland, which in the 90s was a family vacation website and then it was inactive for a couple of years before becoming Bill Simmons' pop-culture website. I also looked at Facebook.</li>
