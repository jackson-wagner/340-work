# Week 11 Assignment

## Jackson Wagner

I was late getting this assignment in, but it was actually a pretty fun one to work on and one that I didn't struggle too much with. I put together the parallax very similar to the one in our instructions, and for the most part got everything to work out pretty well I think.

I struggled for a while with text showing up on top of other text. I tried to have some text show up over the first background image and some at the bottom, but for some reason they were both showing up at the same spot, which made it look pretty bad. I ended up just deleting the bottom text because it was useless information anyway.

Another thing that I struggled with, which I have done a couple weeks in a row now, is forgetting to put the my style.css into a folder called css so it links correctly. A silly mistake, but I couldn't figure out why my page was in all black aand white for a little bit.

The pictures themselves also gave me a bit of a tough time, but your advice in the email to other students helped fix that problem. I put the images foler inside my week-11-assignment folder instead of inside the css folder. Once I made that change the site looked pretty good.
